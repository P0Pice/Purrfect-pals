# YouTube Title Optimizer

## Description

The YouTube Title Optimizer is a web application designed to help content creators optimize their YouTube video titles. By leveraging the power of AI, specifically the Google Gemini API, this tool provides suggestions to improve title effectiveness and potentially increase video visibility.

## Features

-   **Title Input:** Users can enter their current or draft YouTube video title.
-   **AI-Powered Suggestions:** Receives title optimization suggestions generated by the Google Gemini API.
-   **User-Friendly Interface:** A clean and simple UI built with React for ease of use.
-   **Separate Frontend and Backend:** Modular design with a React frontend and a Flask (Python) backend.

## Tech Stack

-   **Frontend:**
    -   React (bootstrapped with Vite)
    -   HTML5
    -   CSS3
-   **Backend:**
    -   Flask (Python)
    -   `python-dotenv` (for environment variable management)
-   **API:**
    -   Google Gemini API
-   **Development & Testing (Backend):**
    -   pytest
    -   pytest-mock

## Project Structure

The project is organized into two main directories: `frontend` and `backend`.

```

## Setup and Running the Project

### Prerequisites

-   Node.js and npm (or yarn)
-   Python 3.x and pip

### Environment Variables

The backend requires a Google Gemini API key to function.

1.  Navigate to the `backend` directory:
    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```
2.  Copy the example environment file:
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
3.  Open the `.env` file and replace `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE` with your actual Google Gemini API key.
    ```
    GEMINI_API_KEY=YOUR_ACTUAL_GEMINI_API_KEY
    ```
    The `backend/app.py` is configured to load this key using `python-dotenv`.

### Backend Setup

1.  Navigate to the `backend` directory:
    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```
2.  Create a Python virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```
3.  Activate the virtual environment:
    -   On macOS/Linux:
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```
    -   On Windows:
        ```bash
        venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
4.  Install the required Python packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
5.  (Optional) To run tests, install development dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
    pytest
    ```
6.  Run the Flask backend server:
    ```bash
    flask run
    ```
    If you encounter issues with `flask run` (e.g., `FLASK_APP` not found), you can try:
    ```bash
    python -m flask run
    ```
    Or set the `FLASK_APP` environment variable:
    ```bash
    export FLASK_APP=app.py # For macOS/Linux
    # set FLASK_APP=app.py # For Windows
    flask run
    ```
    The backend server will typically start on `http://localhost:5000`.

### Frontend Setup

1.  Navigate to the React application directory:
    ```bash
    cd frontend/youtube-title-optimizer-frontend
    ```
2.  Install Node.js dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install 
    # or if you prefer yarn:
    # yarn install
    ```
3.  Start the React development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or if you prefer yarn:
    # yarn dev
    ```
    The frontend development server will typically start on `http://localhost:5173` (Vite's default) and will open automatically in your browser.

### Accessing the Application

-   **Frontend (React App):** `http://localhost:5173` (or the port shown in your terminal after running `npm run dev`)
-   **Backend API (Flask):** `http://localhost:5000`
